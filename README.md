# Portfolio

![alt text](portPreview.png)

## Description
    A project where I created a portfolio page for myself to showcase my skills dealing with HTML and CSS design. Currently a work in progress and will be updated as I learn new skills dealing with front end application. This could be used to see my progression as a full stack developer to see how a started and how advanced my skills have been honed as I delved deeper in learning both front end and back end.
## Installation
    There is nothing that has to be done to run the webpage just open it in a browser.
